# Rancho Sante Fe Fire Prevention Permitting Application (.NET)

This repository contains the source for the RSF Fire Prevention application.

To build the code, you will need:

 * Visual Studio 2013 update 4
 * SQL Server 2012
 * Entity Framwwork 6.1

Start by connecting to your instance of SQL Server 2012 and run the SQL script in the RSFFireData project.

Next you will need to change the databse connection strings in the RSFireData project's App.config file.
